# Sovran Wealth Fund (SWF) Token

## Overview

The Sovran Wealth Fund (SWF) is an ERC20 token built on the Polygon blockchain using ThirdWeb's smart contract libraries. It features role-based minting permissions, pausable functionality, burning capabilities, and an advanced staking system through the SoloMethodEngine.

- **Contract Metadata**: Customizable token name, symbol, and decimals
- **Standard ERC20 Compatibility**: Works with all ERC20-compatible wallets and exchanges
- **SoloMethodEngine Staking**: Stake tokens for 5% APR rewards with 16-wallet distribution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat development environment
- Polygon Amoy testnet account with POL tokens

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
   POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key
   ```

### Local Testing

Run a local Hardhat node:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy to the local network:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/fullTest.js --network localhost
```

### Testnet Deployment

Deploy to Polygon Amoy testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAmoyMinimal.js --network amoy
```

Monitor deployment status:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/checkDeployment.js --network amoy
```

## Usage

### Token Operations

After SWF token deployment, you can:

1. Mint new tokens (if you have the MINTER_ROLE)
2. Transfer tokens between accounts
3. Pause/unpause all transfers (if you're the owner)
4. Burn tokens

See the [SWF Token Management Guide](SWF_TOKEN_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on token operations.

### Staking Operations

After SoloMethodEngine deployment, you can:

1. Approve token spending by the staking contract
2. Stake SWF tokens (minimum 50 SWF)
3. View your staking status and wallet distribution
4. Claim rewards after 30 days (5% APR)
5. Withdraw staked tokens at any time

Use the `swf-staking-manager.js` tool or follow the [SWF Staking Guide](SWF_STAKING_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## Security Features

### Token Security
- Role-based access control for minting permissions
- Only the contract owner can pause/unpause transfers
- Token holders can only burn their own tokens
- No backdoors or admin functions to manipulate balances

### Staking Security
- Minimum 50 SWF staking requirement prevents dust attacks
- Permission-based reward minting prevents unauthorized rewards
- Staked tokens remain safely held in the SoloMethodEngine contract
- Robust withdrawal mechanism with automatic rewards claiming
- No time lock on withdrawals, allowing users to exit at any time
